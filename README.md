# Address Book
Address book that utilizes the local storage functionality added with HTML5.

This means that it doesn't use a database, but instead uses the users device for storage.

## Pros and Cons

The pros using localstorage is:
- Privacy is respected a little more.

The Cons:
- The information is only available on the device, that was used by the user.

It is however possible to make it work with multiple devices. The only thing that it required is a function to sync the information. Doing this however may compromise the privacy of the user.

## Demo
I have a live demo at my website, which can be seen following this link:
